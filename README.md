# Apple Stock Price Analysis & Forecast 📊
This is my first data science and quantitative analysis project, where I analyzed Apple (AAPL) stock data from 2019 to 2024 using Python.
## 🚀 Project Highlights:
- Pulled real-time historical stock data using `yfinance`
- Visualized stock trends with `matplotlib`
- Analyzed key events and trends from 2019 to 2024
- Built a basic linear regression model for forecasting
- Compared predicted values with actual 2024 stock data
## 🔍 Key Insights:
- Apple stock showed a steady growth from 2019 to early 2022
- A significant drop happened in early 2022, reaching levels close to 2020
- By 2024, the stock recovered and hit new highs beyond previous peaks
- The linear model gave a forecast surprisingly close to reality!
## 📈 Technologies Used:
- Python 🐍
- yfinance
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
## 💡 Future Steps:
- Explore advanced time series models (ARIMA, LSTM)
- Add more financial indicators
- Build a dashboard for real-time stock insights

📌 This project is part of my learning journey in data science and quantitative finance.
